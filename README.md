# PanoramaStiching
Python + OpenCV to stitch panoramas

If you are using openCV 3 then use the opencv-contrib-python package instead of opencv-python
* Uninstall opencv-python if you've installed it by running 'pip uninstall opencv-python'
* Install opencv-contrib-python by using 'pip install opencv-contrib-python'
* Check whether you are able to import cv2 using terminal or any ide.
* If the import fails on Windows, make sure you have Visual C++ redistributable 2015 installed. If you are using older Windows version than Windows 10 and latest system updates are not installed, Universal C Runtime might be also required.
